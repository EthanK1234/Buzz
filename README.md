BuzzGame is a simple number game where you count up and replace certain numbers with "buzz". You can play by yourself or against a bot.  
1. Pick a difficulty: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`.  
2. Enter one or more buzz numbers (or type `"random"`).  
3. Choose if you want to play against a bot.  
4. Start counting:
   - If the next number is divisible by or contains a buzz number, type `"buzz"`.  
   - Otherwise, type the number.  
5. The game ends if you make a mistake.
